Answer each of the following questions.
a) What does it mean to choose numbers “at random”?
    ##A random sample or method is one in which all numbers involved have an equal chance of being chosen.
    ## Choosing numbers at random means selecting numbers without any specific pattern or order. This can be done by using a random number generator or by using a method
    such as rolling dice or drawing cards from a deck.



b) Why is the rand function useful for simulating games of chance?
    ## It is useful because you can generate any number range where any number in the range has an equal chance of coming up in play.
    ##it generates random numbers that can be used to simulate the outcomes of a game.
    This allows developers to create realistic simulations of games such as dice, cards, and roulette.
    The randomness of the numbers generated by the rand function ensures that no two games will be exactly the same,
    making it a great tool for creating realistic simulations.




c) Why would you randomize a program by using srand? Under what circumstances is it
desirable not to randomize?
    ## Srand is used to randomize a program by
    generating a random number based on the system
    time. This is desirable when you want to create
    unpredictable outcomes, such as in games or
    simulations. It is also useful for testing
    programs, as it can help uncover bugs that may
    not be apparent with predictable results.

    ##In some cases, it may be desirable not to
     randomize a program. For example, if you are
     running an experiment and need consistent
     results, randomizing the program could
     introduce unwanted variability and make it
     difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from
     the data. Additionally, if you are running a
     critical system where reliability is paramount,
     randomizing the program could introduce unexpected
     behavior that could lead to errors or crashes.






d) Why is it often necessary to scale and/or shift the values produced by rand?
    ## to ensure that the values produced are within a desired range. For example, if you wanted to generate random numbers between 0 and 1, you would need
    to scale and shift the values produced by rand.
